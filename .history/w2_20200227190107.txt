2016年即将过去，新年的钟声即将敲响。在这辞旧迎新的美好时刻，我向全国各族人民，向香港特别行政区

同胞、澳门特别行政区同胞，向台湾同胞和海外侨胞，向世界各国各地区的朋友们，致以新年的祝福！

The year of 2016 is coming to an end, and the

bell of the New Year is going to ring.

At this happy moment of ringing out the old year

and ringing in the new, I would like to extend my

New Year wishes to people from all ethnic groups

across China, to our compatriots from Hong Kong

and Macao Special Administrative Regions, to our

compatriots from Taiwan region and overseas, and

to friends from all countries and regions across

the world.

2016年，对中国人民来说，是非凡的一年，也是难忘的一年，“十三五”实现了开门红。我们积极践行新发展

理念，加快全面建成小康社会进程，推动我国经济增长继续走在世界前列。我们积极推进全面深化改革，供给

侧结构性改革迈出重要步伐，国防和军队改革取得重大突破，各领域具有四梁八柱性质的改革主体框架已经基

本确立。我们积极推进全面依法治国，深化司法体制改革，全力促进司法公正、维护社会公平正义。我们积极

推进全面从严治党，坚定不移“打虎拍蝇”，继续纯净政治生态，党风、政风、社会风气继续好转。

For the Chinese people, the year of 2016 is not

only outstanding but also unforgettable. We made

a good start of the 13th 5-year National

Development Period which spans from 2016 to 2020.

We actively carried out the new development

concept, accelerated the process of building

a moderately prosperous society in an all-round

way, and maintained our economic growth ranking

the first in the world. We vigorously pushed

forward the comprehensive deepening of reform,

made important steps in terms of supply-side

structural reform, achieved remarkable

breakthroughs in the reform of national defense

and the military, and the main frame of reform

in all fields with "multiple pillars" has been

established. We actively promoted the building of

a law-based governance of the country, deepened

the reform on the judicial system, enhanced

judicial justice in an all-round way, and

maintained social fairness and justice.

We vigorously pushed forward the exercise of

our Party's strict governance in every respect,

unswervingly cracked down on both "tigers"

and "flies", in a bid to purify our political

ecosystem, and continue to improve our Party

and our government's working style, as well

as our social conduct.

2016年，“中国天眼”落成启用，“悟空”号已在轨运行一年，“墨子号”飞向太空，神舟十一号和天宫

二号遨游星汉，中国奥运健儿勇创佳绩，中国女排时隔12年再次登上奥运会最高领奖台……还有，通过改革，农

村转移人口市民化更便利了，许多贫困地区孩子们上学条件改善了，老百姓异地办理身份证不用来回奔波了，一

些长期无户口的人可以登记户口了，很多群众有了自己的家庭医生，每条河流要有“河长”了……这一切，让我

们感到欣慰。

In the year of 2016, the Chinese "sky-eye"

single-aperture spherical telescope came

into use officially, the "WuKong" dark matter

detection satellite was under operation in the

orbit for a year, the "Mozi" quantum satellite

was launched into space, the Shenzhou-11 manned

spaceship and the Tiangong-2 space lab traveled

through the Galaxy, the Chinese Olympians made

outstanding achievements, including the Chinese

Women's Volleyball team's becoming the Olympic

champion again, which is 12 years after they won

the title. Furthermore, our reform measures have

made it a little easier for rural migrant workers

to settle down in urban areas, and the condition

for many children from impoverished areas to

receive education has also improved, people don't

need to shuttle back and forth between different

places when they apply for an identity card in

non-native places, some people without permanent

household residence for a long time can finally

get access to social welfare, many people even

have got their own family doctors, and "river

chiefs" will be appointed across China for better

protection of water resources against pollution

in the country. All those efforts make us feel

a sense of achievement.

2016年，在美丽的西子湖畔，我们举办了二十国集团领导人第十一次峰会，向世界贡献了中国智慧、中国方

案，也向世界展示了美轮美奂的中国印象、中国风采。“一带一路”建设快速推进，亚洲基础设施投资银行

正式开张。我们坚持和平发展，坚决捍卫领土主权和海洋权益。谁要在这个问题上做文章，中国人民决不答

应！

In the year of 2016, near the beautiful West Lake

in Hangzhou city, we held the 11th G20 Leaders'

Summit, we shared our thoughts with world leaders

and proposed our ideas, and also presented to the

world the magnificent, impressive and elegant

image of China. The projects under "The Belt and

One Road" Initiative was also pushed forward, and

the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank

officially started operation. We have adhered to

the peaceful development while resolutely

safeguarding the territorial sovereignty and

maritime rights and interests of China. We will

never tolerate any act that undermines our

territorial sovereignty and maritime rights.

这一年，多地发生的自然灾害和安全事故，给人民生命财产和生产生活造成严重损失，我们深感痛惜。中国维和部

队的几名同志壮烈牺牲，为世界和平献出了宝贵生命，我们怀念他们，要把他们的亲人照顾好。

In the year of 2016, natural disasters and

industrial accidents took place in many places

across China, bringing severe losses on people's

life and property, as well as production. We

deeply regret those mishaps. On the international

front, a few comrades from China's peacekeeping

troops have sacrificed their lives while serving

their duty to safeguard world peace, we mourn the

loss of these soldiers and will repay high tribute

to them by taking a good care of their loved ones.

2016年，我们隆重庆祝了中国共产党成立95周年、纪念了中国工农红军长征胜利80周年，我们要牢记为中

国人民和中华民族作出贡献的前辈们，不忘初心、继续前进。

In the year of 2016, we held grand ceremonies to

mark a series of important anniversaries including

the 95th founding anniversary of the Communist

Party of China, and the 80th anniversary of the

triumph of the Long March by the Red Army of

Chinese workers and peasants. We will always

cherish the memory of the forefathers who have

made great contributions to the Chinese people

and the Chinese nation. We will remain committed

to our mission, and continue to forge ahead.

“新故相推，日生不滞。”即将到来的2017年，中国共产党将召开第十九次全国代表大会，全面建成小康社

会、全面深化改革、全面依法治国、全面从严治党要继续发力。天上不会掉馅饼，努力奋斗才能梦想成真。

An ancient saying goes, "the world moves on in

a never-ending process of the new replacing

the old." In the upcoming year of 2017, the

Communist Party of China will convene its 19th

national congress, an occasion to renew our

commitment to the comprehensive building of

a moderately prosperous society in all respects,

to the comprehensive deepening of reforms,

to the comprehensive advancement of rule of law,

and to the comprehensive exercising of

self-governance of the party. There is no such

thing as a free lunch, and only hard work will

make dreams come true.

小康路上一个都不能掉队！一年来，又有1000多万贫困人口实现了脱贫，奋战在脱贫攻坚一线的同志们辛苦

了，我向同志们致敬。新年之际，我最牵挂的还是困难群众，他们吃得怎么样、住得怎么样，能不能过好新

年、过好春节。我也了解，部分群众在就业、子女教育、就医、住房等方面还面临一些困难，不断解决好这

些问题是党和政府义不容辞的责任。全党全社会要继续关心和帮助贫困人口和有困难的群众，让改革发展成

果惠及更多群众，让人民生活更加幸福美满。

We will make sure that no one is left behind on

our way to prosperity. Over the past year, 10

million more people across the country have been

lifted out of poverty. I would like to pay high

tribute and express appreciation to the comrades

who have worked tremendously in grass root unites

in fighting poverty. As we greet the New Year,

there is one thing that remains most dearly

attached to my heart. That is those fellow

citizens who still live in hardship. I'm seriously

concerned and wonder how their food supply and

accommodation are being maintained, how they are

celebrating the New Year and the Spring Festival.

I'm aware that some folks are faced with

difficulties in employment, children's education,

medical care and housing. To ceaselessly solve

those problems remain an unshirkable

responsibility for the party and the government.

The whole party and the whole society should show

continued care and offer help to those fellow

citizens living in poverty. We will enable more

people to enjoy the fruit of our reforms, and

ultimately let all the people in this country

live in happiness.

上下同欲者胜。只要我们13亿多人民和衷共济，只要我们党永远同人民站在一起，大家撸起袖子加油干，我

们就一定能够走好我们这一代人的长征路。

中国人历来主张“世界大同，天下一家”。中国人民不仅希望自己过得好，也希望各国人民过得好。当前，战

乱和贫困依然困扰着部分国家和地区，疾病和灾害也时时侵袭着众多的人们。我真诚希望，国际社会携起手来，

秉持人类命运共同体的理念，把我们这个星球建设得更加和平、更加繁荣。

让我们满怀信心和期待，一起迎接新年的钟声！

May the chime of the New Year consolidate our
