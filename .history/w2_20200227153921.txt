For the Chinese people, the year of 2016 is not

only outstanding but also unforgettable. We made

a good start of the 13th 5-year National

Development Period which spans from 2016 to 2020.

We actively carried out the new development

concept, accelerated the process of building

a moderately prosperous society in an all-round

way, and maintained our economic growth ranking

the first in the world. We vigorously pushed

forward the comprehensive deepening of reform,

made important steps in terms of supply-side

structural reform, achieved remarkable

breakthroughs in the reform of national defense

and the military, and the main frame of reform

in all fields with &quot;multiple pillars&quot; has been

established. We actively promoted the building of

a law-based governance of the country, deepened

the reform on the judicial system, enhanced

judicial justice in an all-round way, and

maintained social fairness and justice.

We vigorously pushed forward the exercise of

our Party&#39;s strict governance in every respect,

unswervingly cracked down on both &quot;tigers&quot;

and &quot;flies&quot;, in a bid to purify our political

ecosystem, and continue to improve our Party

and our government&#39;s working style, as well

as our social conduct.

outstanding achievements, including the Chinese

Women&#39;s Volleyball team&#39;s becoming the Olympic

champion again, which is 12 years after they won

the title. Furthermore, our reform measures have

made it a little easier for rural migrant workers

to settle down in urban areas, and the condition

for many children from impoverished areas to

receive education has also improved, people don&#39;t

need to shuttle back and forth between different

places when they apply for an identity card in

non-native places, some people without permanent

household residence for a long time can finally

get access to social welfare, many people even

have got their own family doctors, and &quot;river

protection of water resources against pollution

in the country. All those efforts make us feel

a sense of achievement.

In the year of 2016, natural disasters and

industrial accidents took place in many places

across China, bringing severe losses on people&#39;s

life and property, as well as production. We

deeply regret those mishaps. On the international

front, a few comrades from China&#39;s peacekeeping

troops have sacrificed their lives while serving

their duty to safeguard world peace, we mourn the

loss of these soldiers and will repay high tribute

to them by taking a good care of their loved ones.

We will make sure that no one is left behind on

our way to prosperity. Over the past year, 10

million more people across the country have been

lifted out of poverty. I would like to pay high

tribute and express appreciation to the comrades

who have worked tremendously in grass root unites

in fighting poverty. As we greet the New Year,

there is one thing that remains most dearly

attached to my heart. That is those fellow

citizens who still live in hardship. I&#39;m seriously

concerned and wonder how their food supply and

accommodation are being maintained, how they are

celebrating the New Year and the Spring Festival.

I&#39;m aware that some folks are faced with

difficulties in employment, children&#39;s education,

medical care and housing. To ceaselessly solve

those problems remain an unshirkable

responsibility for the party and the government.

The whole party and the whole society should show

continued care and offer help to those fellow

citizens living in poverty. We will enable more

people to enjoy the fruit of our reforms, and

ultimately let all the people in this country

live in happiness.

a moderately prosperous society in all respects,

to the comprehensive deepening of reforms,

to the comprehensive advancement of rule of law,

and to the comprehensive exercising of

self-governance of the party. There is no such

thing as a free lunch, and only hard work will

make dreams come true.

We will make sure that no one is left behind on

our way to prosperity. Over the past year, 10

million more people across the country have been

lifted out of poverty. I would like to pay high

tribute and express appreciation to the comrades

who have worked tremendously in grass root unites

in fighting poverty. As we greet the New Year,

there is one thing that remains most dearly

attached to my heart. That is those fellow

citizens who still live in hardship. I&#39;m seriously

concerned and wonder how their food supply and

accommodation are being maintained, how they are

celebrating the New Year and the Spring Festival.

I&#39;m aware that some folks are faced with

difficulties in employment, children&#39;s education,

medical care and housing. To ceaselessly solve

those problems remain an unshirkable

responsibility for the party and the government.

The whole party and the whole society should show

continued care and offer help to those fellow

citizens living in poverty. We will enable more

people to enjoy the fruit of our reforms, and

ultimately let all the people in this country

live in happiness.
